This page lists useful tool, and examples (not just in Python) for accessing Google Docs.

  * GoogleCL (http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/)
> > GoogleCL brings Google services to the command line.

  * gdatacopier (http://code.google.com/p/gdatacopier/)
> > Command line document management utilities for Google docs.

  * FUSE Google Drive (https://github.com/jcline/fuse-google-drive)
> > A FUSE user-space filesystem for Google Drive, written in C.

  * Grive (https://github.com/Grive/grive)
> > An independent open-source implementation of a Google Drive client. It uses the Google Document List API to talk to the servers in Google. The code is written in C++.

  * gdrive-cli (https://github.com/tom-dignan/gdrive-cli)
> > A command-line interface for GDrive. This uses the GDrive API, not the GDocs API, which is interesting. To use it, you need to register a chrome application. It must be at least installable by you, but need not be published. There is a boilerplate app in the repo you can use as a starting point.

  * python-fuse example (git://src.develer.com/users/th30z/python-fuse/.git)
> > Contains some slides and examples of Python FUSE filesystems.

  * Google Docs FS (http://code.google.com/p/google-docs-fs/), an earlier attempt at a Fuse FS in Python, no longer maintained, uses the old Docs API.
